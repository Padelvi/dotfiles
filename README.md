## My system dotfiles

This is my repo for my dev dotfiles. I'm in arch linux (with swaywm), but they should not be limited to arch.

Also, as a dev, I code in python (and also starting with rust). My editor is neovim.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Swaylock
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Gtk3
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh)
- Neovim (using AstroNvim)

### Installation

No install.sh script yet. I am planning to make one soon.

### Theme

For my first rice, I was trying the [nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord) theme. So thanks to them!
