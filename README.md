## Configs

This is my repo for my configs. I'm in arch linux, but probably they will work on other linux systems anyways.

I am going to do an install script soon probably.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh): .zshrc and my aliases file

For my nvim config (managed with [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)), see my other [repo](https://github.com/Padelvi/astro-config).
