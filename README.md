## My system dotfiles

This is my repo for my dev dotfiles. I'm in arch linux (with swaywm), but they should not be limited to arch.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Swaylock
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Wlogout
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh)
- Neovim

### Installation

No install.sh script yet. I am planning to make one soon.
