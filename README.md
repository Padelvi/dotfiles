## My system dotfiles

This is my repo for my dev dotfiles. I'm currently migrating from arch linux to artix with dinit. I use swaywm. 

The dotfiles, should not be limited to arch or artix, but I'll just ensure that they work with artix.

Also, as a dev, I code in python (and also starting with rust). My editor is neovim.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Swaylock
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Gtk3
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh)
- Neovim (using AstroNvim)

Also you will notice [aur.txt](https://github.com/Padelvi/dotfiles/blob/main/aur.txt) and [pkglist.txt](https://github.com/Padelvi/dotfiles/blob/main/pkglist.txt) in the root dir. Those contain package lists for arch or artix (If you have support for the extra repo).

### Installation

I am starting to make an [install.py](https://github.com/Padelvi/dotfiles/blob/main/install.py) script (obviously no deps). I would make an sh script but I know more about python scripting.

### Theme

For my first rice, I was trying the [nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord) theme. So thanks to them!

### License

I decided to license this repo (unlike the rest) under MIT so everyone can use this without any limitations. See more [here](https://github.com/Padelvi/dotfiles/blob/main/LICENSE).
