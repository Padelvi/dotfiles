## My system dotfiles

This is my repo for my dev dotfiles. I'm in arch linux (with swaywm), but they should not be limited to arch.

Also, as a dev, I code in python (and also starting with rust). My editor is neovim.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Swaylock
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Gtk3
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh)
- Neovim (using AstroNvim)

### Installation

I am starting to make an install.py script (obviously no deps). I would make an sh script but I know more about python scripting.

### Theme

For my first rice, I was trying the [nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord) theme. So thanks to them!

### Thanks

My dots for my nord theme uses these repos (thanks to their authors):

- [Base16-kitty](https://github.com/kdrag0n/base16-kitty) for the kitty theme config.
- [Base16-sway](https://github.com/rkubosz/base16-sway) for the sway nord theme config.
- [This repo](https://github.com/cafecitohippo/nordicvectors) for the wallpapers.
