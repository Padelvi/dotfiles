## My system dotfiles

This is my repo for my dev dotfiles. I'm in arch linux, but probably they will work on other linux systems anyways.

For now, I have added my configs for:

- My completion scripts
- Sway
- Waybar
- SwayNC
- Kitty
- Wlogout
- Zsh (I use oh-my-zsh)

For my nvim config (managed with [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)), see my other [repo](https://github.com/Padelvi/astro-config).

### Installation

No install.sh script yet. I am planning to make one soon.
